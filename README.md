## Overview

This repository is a project demonstrating that I have achieved the learning outcomes of this module along with some sample work.

## About the Project
This repository contains lab work and the assessment for the Theory of Algorithms module. This assessment had a number of requirements that needed to be fulfilled in order to complete the tasks at hand.

I was required to create two Jupyter notebooks, `post-correspondence.ipynb` and `countdown.ipynb`.

### `post-correspondence.ipynb`
  This notebook should contain:
  1. Definition and explanation of the Post Correspondence Problem.
  2. Definition and explanation of the Bounded Post Correspondence Problem.
  3. Python function to solve the Bounded Post Correspondence Problem. The function should take two lists of strings and return **True** if they corresponde, **False** otherwise.
  4. Explanation of what an undecidable problem is in computabibility theory, with reference to the Post Correspondence Problem.
### `countdown.ipynb`
  This notebook should contain:
  1. Overview and explanation of the Countdown Numbers Game.
  2. Discussion of the complexity of the Countdown Numbers Game.
  3. Python function, written in a functional programming style to solve a Countdown Numbers Game. The function should take a list of six numbers and a target
number and return a method to calculate the target from the numbers, if it exists.
  4. Explanation of the functional aspects of your code.

## So what is in this Repository

## Technologies Used
The technologies used in this project were:  
1. [Python](#python)
2. [Jupyter Lab](#jupyter-lab)
3. [Anaconda](#anaconda)

### [Python](https://www.python.org/)
Python is a general purpose and high level programming language. This means that it can be used to create a variety of different programs and isn't specialized for any specific problem. Notebooks use Python so it was essential to use Python for this project.

### [Jupyter Lab](https://jupyter.org/)
Jupyter Lab is a web-based interactive development environment for notebooks, code and data. Its flexible interface allows users to configure and arrange workflows in data science, scientific computing, computational journalism and machine learning. Jupyter Lab runs in a single tab, with sub-tabs displayed within that one tab, Jupyter Lab opens new notebooks in new tabs. This helps to visualize the two notebooks in this project and allows for simple modification to both notebooks.

### [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/) 
Anaconda is an open-source package and environment management system which already comes with many of the libraries that will need to be installed manually if you choose to install this project via Python, however if you do not use Python regularly it is better practice to install via Python as it will take up much less space on your device as you will not be installing the countless libraries Anaconda provides that you will never use.

## How to Install
1. Open CMD (Command Prompt) or a terminal window and navigate to the location where you want to clone this repository.
2. Type `git clone https://github.com/PatrickMurray78/theory-of-algorithms` and press Enter.
3. The repository should now be cloned.

## How to Run
1. Open CMD (Command Prompt) or a terminal window and navigate to the location where you cloned this repository.
2. Type `jupyter lab`.
3. Jupyter Lab will then launch in your browser, you can edit the notebooks and run them as you wish.
